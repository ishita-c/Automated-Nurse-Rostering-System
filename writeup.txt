Automated Nurse Rostering System

Part A: Rostering with Constraints

1) Slots are alloted to nurses day-wise. 
    The constraints of m "M", a "A" and e "E" slots are checked after alloting slots for the day.
    The constraint of atleast one "R" slot for a nurse is checked while alloting their slot for the last day of the week.
    The constraint that "M" and "E" slots are not followed by "M" slot the next day are checked when alloting a slot for a each nurse.

2) Inferences Considered
    i) If a nurse gets assigned "M" or "E" for a day, the slot "M" is removed from next day's domain.
    ii) While alloting slots for any day, counts for no. of "M", "A" and "E" slots alloted so far for that day are maintained.
        If on assigning a variable, any of the m "M", a "A" or e "E" slots constraint gets satisfied, the corresponding slot is removed from 
        domains of unassigned nurses of the day.

3) Selecting Unassigned Variable
    The unassigned variable of the smallest domain is chosen.

4) Ordering Domain Values
    Each day, exactly r = N - m - a - e nurses, are chosen and they are given "R" as the first choice in their domain.
    After this, a fixed ordering of remaining domain values is followed, "A" > "M" > "E".
